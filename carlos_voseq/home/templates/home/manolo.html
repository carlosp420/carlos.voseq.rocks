      <h2>Manolo.rocks</h2>
      <p>
        I started the project Manolo. <a href="https://manolo.rocks">Manolo</a> is a simple search
        tool that contains the visitor
        records of several government institutions in Peru. You can type any person name and search
        for their visits to public institutions. The project is built with Django and PostgreSQL.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        When the project started, the list of visitors to Peruvian institutions were online but
      difficult to use. There was no way to search for any person of interest. Journalists had
      to comb through many pages looking for persons names. They could spend many hours just looking
      through the records of one single institution. Imagine, doing the same for many institutions!</p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        In order to help them, I wrote a bunch of web scrapers that downloaded all the records,
      stored everything into a PostgreSQL database and created a simple search tool. The project
      helped journalists to find the information they needed in a matter of seconds.</p>

      <p class="mt-2">
        The project became popular and several volunteers joined to write additional spiders,
        bug fixes and improvements to the cod. The project is still active and it is used by journalists.

        Manolo is currently sponsored by <a href="https://laencerrona.pe/">La Encerrona</a>,
        an independent media outlet in Peru.</p>
